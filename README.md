# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Classification-and-Database-Integration-

This project focuses on classifying diabetic retinopathy using machine learning techniques and integrating a diabetic retinopathy dataset for analysis.

Overview

Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes that can lead to blindness if left untreated. This project aims to develop a model to classify the severity of diabetic retinopathy from retinal images. It also involves integrating and preprocessing the dataset for effective model training.

Features

Dataset Integration: Includes steps to integrate and preprocess the diabetic retinopathy dataset.
Model Development: Utilizes machine learning techniques for classification.
Evaluation: Evaluates model performance using standard metrics.
Technologies Used

Python
TensorFlow
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib
